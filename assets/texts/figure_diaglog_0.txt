Doc-- or should I say Alonzo Parson: former employee of Helionix Industries am I wrong?
What are you talking about-– Who are you? Alonzo– no I'm Zebulon– Doctor Zebulon Francis...
Haha-- Keep the humor to a minimum. I have a job for you Alonzo. A very important job...
Job? I perfer to stick to my own buisness reparing cyber-tech. I'm not interested.
Listen carefully to my instructions or the government documents reporting your death and retirement from Helionix Industries might be a bit more true than you would prefer...
...
Good. Meet me in the alley behind Lycia Cafe later. I will give you a port key and you will then use the cafe facilities.
The cafe?
Yes, I need some data harvested.
Data harvesting?! Isn't that illegal!
Only illegal if I say so bud. After all Fusiogenic Solutions asked for ya.
Be there sharp or you will have a visit from the Fusiogenic police.
